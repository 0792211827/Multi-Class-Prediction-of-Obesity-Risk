# Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk
## Overview

**Title:* Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk

**Overview:*Welcome to 2024 Kaggle Playground Series Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk!.Accurate prediction of obesity risk is crucial for early intervention and prevention of associated health issues like cardiovascular disease. This competition aims to use various factors, such as demographic and lifestyle data, to build models that predict an individual's obesity risk level.

**Aim:**Your task in this challenge is to develop machine learning models that leverage the provided dataset to predict obesity risk. The goal is to classify individuals into different obesity risk categories based on their characteristics and behaviors. Successful models will help healthcare professionals and policymakers identify high-risk individuals and implement targeted preventive measures.
## Importance of the Model
* **Public Health Improvement:** By accurately predicting obesity risk, the model can help identify individuals at high risk of developing obesity-related health conditions. Early identification allows for timely interventions, which can prevent the onset of these conditions and improve overall public health.
* **Resource Allocation:** Healthcare resources can be allocated more efficiently by targeting high-risk individuals with preventive measures, nutritional guidance, and physical activity programs. This ensures that resources are used where they are most needed, maximizing their impact.
* **Policy and Planning:** The insights gained from the model can inform public health policies and initiatives. Governments and health organizations can use the predictions to design and implement targeted campaigns to reduce obesity rates, ultimately leading to healthier populations and reduced healthcare costs.

## Model Overview
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, relationships between features, and identifying important predictors.
* **Model Selection:** Comparing algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Xgb boost to find the best model.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training the selected model and evaluating its performance using accuracy, precision and recall.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model hyperparameters for better performance.
## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Utilizing Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.
* **Data Visualization:** Using visualization tools and libraries to understand data distributions, relationships, and model performance.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing algorithms to predict obesity risk based on the provided dataset.
